# Project Background
Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"
Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that?
# Part 1: WeatherPy
In this deliverable, you'll create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. You'll use the citipy Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and your problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.
# Part 2: VacationPy
In this deliverable, you'll use your weather data skills to plan future vacations. Also, you'll use Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API.
